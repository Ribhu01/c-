# To-Do List Manager

This program is a simple to-do list manager implemented in C++. It allows users to add tasks, view tasks, and quit the program. Tasks are stored in a file named "tasks.txt".

## Usage

1. **Adding a Task**: Press `A` or `a` when prompted to add a task. Then, enter the task when prompted.

2. **Viewing Tasks**: Press `V` or `v` to view the current list of tasks.

3. **Quitting the Program**: Press `Q` or `q` to quit the program.

## Instructions

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Ensure the file `tasks.txt` exists in the same directory as the executable.
3. Run the executable.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the to-do list manager.

## Notes

- Tasks are stored persistently in the `tasks.txt` file. They will be loaded into the program when it starts and saved back to the file when the program exits.
- Input validation is not implemented in this version, so ensure to enter valid choices and tasks.
